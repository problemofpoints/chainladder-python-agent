# Roundtable Session

Are you going to the round table? Below is a list of things that we can cover, we will go through as many items as possible.

Remember that you will need to bring your laptop, but there's nothing that you need to do before coming to the round table.

  1. Re-work the [full demo workbook](https://github.com/casact/chainladder-python/blob/master/docs/tutorials/demo-blank.ipynb) from the Concurrent Session and complete the exercises

      - Open in [Google Colab](https://githubtocolab.com/casact/chainladder-python/blob/master/docs/tutorials/demo-blank.ipynb) (faster, Google Account required)
      - Open in [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/casact/chainladder-python/master?urlpath=tree/docs/tutorials/demo-blank.ipynb) (slower, no sign up required)

  2. [Install](https://chainladder-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/library/install.html) the package on your computer

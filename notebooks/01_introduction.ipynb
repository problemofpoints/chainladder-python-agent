    "\n",
    "The Chainladder AI Agent is a specialized AI system that helps actuaries and insurance professionals work with triangle data and perform actuarial analyses. It consists of several specialized agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Agent**: Handles triangle data loading, validation, and exploration\n",
    "- **Analysis Agent**: Performs actuarial analyses like Chain Ladder, Mack, Bornhuetter-Ferguson\n",
    "- **Visualization Agent**: Creates data visualizations of triangles and results\n",
    "- **Explanation Agent**: Provides explanations and reports on actuarial concepts\n",
    "- **Supervisor Agent**: Coordinates all the specialized agents\n",

    "1. Python 3.8+ environment with required dependencies installed\n",
